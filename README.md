# SIFT-CPP
Simple implementation of SIFT algorithm for keypoints detection and matching

## Dependencies
- OpenCV (4.x is recommended with opencv_contrib for SIFT)

## Build Instructions

1. Install OpenCV along with opencv_contrib. You can follow the instructions provided in the official [OpenCV documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html).

2. Clone this repository.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/anithavedantam/SIFT-CPP.git
   cd SIFT-CPP

## Usage
For running the keypoints detection and matching using SIFT algorithm, use the following command:
```
./SIFTKeypointMatcher <path-to-image1> <path-to-image2>
```
